        <description>For my standard resume, click here to view it.
Putting enough detail about my projects on a single page was hard, so if you&amp;rsquo;d like more details then I&amp;rsquo;d encourage you to look through this section! There&amp;rsquo;s four sections detailing more of each of my projects:
 Amateur Liquid Fueled Rocket Engine Breadboard Processor Fireworks Shell Taping Machine Custom Video Game Engine(s)  Amateur Liquid Fueled Rocket Engine, Personal Project A long-term side project I&amp;rsquo;ve had to build a working liquid bipropellant rocket engine, with the biggest goal being to learn as much as possible.</description>

        <description>Time I finally posted something :D
I haven&amp;rsquo;t gotten as much done as I&amp;rsquo;d hoped, but I have managed to hack together design a prototype igniter to test out some systems and get a feel for everything. I figure I&amp;rsquo;d start with the igniter as it would be the simplest (and safest) system to prototype, and there&amp;rsquo;s actually flames involved!
Reasoning So why did I choose to do the igniter first?</description>

        <description>For better or for worse, I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to start a blog. I like doing just about anything technical that doesn&amp;rsquo;t involve biology (I still have the battle scars from freshman biology), and this blog should give me a chance to spread my ramblings. It might end up being pretty random, but hey, normal is boring right?
My current main project is to create a liquid fueled rocket engine. Did I mention I&amp;rsquo;m nuts?</description>
