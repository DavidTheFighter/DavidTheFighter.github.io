[{"content":"For better or for worse, I\u0026rsquo;ve decided to start a blog. I like doing just about anything technical that doesn\u0026rsquo;t involve biology (I still have the battle scars from freshman biology), and this blog should give me a chance to spread my ramblings. It might end up being pretty random, but hey, normal is boring right?\nMy current main project is to create a liquid fueled rocket engine. Did I mention I\u0026rsquo;m nuts? I\u0026rsquo;ve created a working torch igniter prototype (that needs a lot of work), and am in the process of finishing up a CNC mini-mill. I\u0026rsquo;ve had my fair share of roadblocks along the way, but needless to say I\u0026rsquo;ve learned a ridiculous amount so far. I\u0026rsquo;m currently away from home and attending college at RIT, so the project is being \u0026ldquo;redirected\u0026rdquo; a bit so that I can still work on parts of it here.\nEven if I can\u0026rsquo;t finish the project, the entire process will (and has been) a great learning experience for me. Regardless of what I\u0026rsquo;m working on you\u0026rsquo;ll get to see my successes and many failures along the way and hopefully get some second-hand learning of what not to do. Feel free to comment and email, as long as it\u0026rsquo;s not purposefully stupid I\u0026rsquo;d love to get feedback. I hope you enjoy, cheers!\n","description":"For better or worse, I'm doing it :)","id":0,"section":"posts","tags":["intro"],"title":"Uh oh, I think I'm starting a blog","uri":"davidthefighter.github.io/posts/intro/"}]
